# ‚ù§ The Jet Community

Jet Protocol is a governance and community driven effort. We seek to implement lessons learned in other governance driven DeFi protocols that have come before us. Planning, building and fostering an amazing community is extremely important to us and as we are able to coalesce around individuals, groups and our shared goals we believe this will make for a stronger, more resilient and self-sustaining ecosystem for Jet Protocol and other DeFi applications to thrive within.&#x20;

Jet Protocol requires innovative, empathetic and bold self-starters who can help us form an early steering committee of decision makers within the community as we launch the product. If you believe you are cut out for this important role, please get in touch with us at: hello\[at]jetprotocol\[dot]io.&#x20;
