### **Assets Supported by Jet Protocol**

Assets (SPL tokens) are onboarded to Jet by the [JetDAO](https://jetdao.fi/). Assets are considered as more or less risky for the protocol during onboarding by governance.&#x20;

The riskier assets can be weighted such that they don't count towards collateral in a margin account at all, while the least risky assets such as USDC can provide up to 15x leverage.&#x20;

Factors that play into the risk are the amount of a token's on-chain liquidity (necessary for liquidation events), ubiquitousness DeFi to such as USDC with consideration towards regulatory and reputational risk as well.&#x20;
