# Sonar Watch

### What is Sonar Watch?

From Sonar Watch Docs&#x20;

> Sonar Watch brings a complete overview of a wallet or public address on the Solana Blockchain. We aim to show on a single page the metrics needed to show the user exactly what state their portfolio is currently in. The tracker takes into account tokens, LPs, farms and staking aggregated on a single dashboard in the lightest way possible. We also support NFTs as they may have monetary value.

### How is Sonar Watch useful for Jet users?

Sonar's dashboard will allow Jet users to analyze their performance on all different assets through historical charts on TVL, Supply, APR and prices.
