## About Jet Protocol

Jet is an open source, non-custodial liquidity protocol pushing the envelope on decentralized finance and debt capital markets efficiency. We offer first class, market based lending products built for the emerging DeFi high flyers. Our bleeding edge on-chain products connect flight operations among crypto-native traders and soon, with permissioned institutional players. We are a remote but close-knit flight crew consisting of veteran pilots with tens of thousands of long-haul flying hours at blue-chip DeFi, TradFi, and Big Tech firms.

A Jet user can borrow against over-collateralized debt positions, and may incur debt up to governance mandated debt ratios. If the value of a user‚Äôs deposited collateral falls under the specified ratio, their position is able to be liquidated by external actors, such as traders or any users who can call the smart contract. In addition to lending, Jet will introduce interest rate product secondary markets on Serum and facilitate ongoing community-driven lending product research & development.
