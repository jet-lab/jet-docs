The statements, proposals, and details contained herein are informational only, and subject to change. We are in early stage development and may need to change dates, details, or the project as a whole based on the protocol, team, legal or regulatory needs, or due to developments of Solana.

Regarding the risks of using Jet Protocol - Users must understand the risks of bleeding edge technology and the Solana programs \(smart contracts\) which allow for decentralized borrowing and lending. Please do your own research before using Jet Protocol and feel free to reach out to the team and community with any questions that are not clarified in these docs.

Risks include impermanent loss, liquidation, loss of funds due to stolen private keys, phishing, external fraud and other unforeseen occurrences. 

Users should follow common best practice for security and conduct their own due diligence. All code in Jet Protocol is novel and experimental. Please use discretion when depositing funds.
