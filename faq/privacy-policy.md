### Data processing in connection with the Site

1. **How We Use Your Information:**

Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies. The Services do not currently use cookies. The third-party vendors we rely on for services do use cookies. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. Information collected from cookies is used by us to evaluate the effectiveness of our Services and analyze trends, or by vendors we use and rely on. The information collected from cookies allows us to determine such things as which parts of the Site are most visited and difficulties our visitors may experience in accessing the Site or Services. With this knowledge, we can improve the quality of your experience with the Services by recognizing and delivering more of the most desired features and information, as well as by resolving access difficulties.&#x20;

We use third party service providers to assist us in better understanding the use of our Services. Our service providers will place cookies in (or use similar technologies) and will receive information that we select that will educate us on such things as how visitors navigate around our Site. This information is aggregated to provide statistical data about our users' browsing actions and patterns, and does not personally identify individuals (however, see below information on Solana wallet addresses). This information may include:&#x20;

* Computer or mobile device information,
* Web Services usage information, such as:
* Page views,
* Account changes (i.e. connecting a wallet) Button clicks,
* Input form changes,
* Errors.

Our service providers analyze this information and provide us with aggregate reports. The information and analysis provided by our service providers will be used to assist us in better understanding our visitors' interests in our Site and Services and how to better serve those interests, as well as help ensure secure use of the Services for all users. If you want to avoid using cookies altogether, you can disable cookies in your browser. However, disabling cookies might make it difficult or impossible for you to use certain features of the Site or Services. Your use of the Site or Services with a browser that is configured to accept cookies constitutes acceptance of our and third-party cookies.

* Public Solana Addresses and Email Addresses. We use and collect public Solana addresses and email addresses to identify and document a user‚Äôs journey through our products and historical use of the Site and Services, as defined in the Terms of Service.

We may also use this data to facilitate individual access to the Site, Services, and linked third party websites, communicate with individuals regarding their use of the Services, and in other ways related to individual use of the Services and the Site. The legal basis for this processing is that it is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, as well as our legitimate interests, such as monitoring and improving the Site and Services, and the proper protection of the Site and Services against risks.
* Geolocation Data and Telephone Numbers. We use and collect the geolocation data and telephone numbers of our Site visitors. The geolocation data is solely used for regional verification. Due to regulatory restrictions, only users in authorized regions are able to access the Services. Telephone numbers are used for security purposes to validate our users. Users will receive a secure access code via SMS (separate rates may apply from your carrier).
* Blockchain Data. Note that we are not responsible for your use of the Solana Blockchain and your data processed in this decentralized and permissionless network.
* Your inquiries. You may contact us by email to the following email address: legal@jetassociation.org. We use the data that you provide in an email to us, which you may give voluntarily, only in order to answer your contact question or to reply to your email in the best possible manner.

We are entitled to transfer your personal data to third parties abroad for the purposes of the data processing and external access by you of services provided by those third parties.
