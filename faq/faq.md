**Is Jet Protocol Permissionless?**

**How do I lend my assets to get interest?**&#x20;

You deposit your assets to the lending pool or fixed rate fixed term marketplace and will earn interest from your deposits.&#x20;

**Are my deposited funds safe?** &#x20;

While Jet Protocol is built by industry veterans and world-class financial systems developers, Jet Protocol as well as Solana are still in beta and you should not deposit more funds than you would be willing to lose. There are no guarantees of safety regarding the programs Jet Protocol is built on.&#x20;

**When will you support \[any] asset?**

Jet Protocol will add new assets based on user demand and the selection criteria and decisions will ultimately be decided by the community and governance body of the protocol. [Click here](https://docs.jetdao.fi) for more information on Governance.

**Is Jet vulnerable to flash loan attacks?**

No. Due to how margin account "health checks" are performed, Flash loans are not possible at this moment. Flash loans may potentially be enabled for usage in the future, while still performing health checks at the relevant times to ensure that an exploit is not possible.
