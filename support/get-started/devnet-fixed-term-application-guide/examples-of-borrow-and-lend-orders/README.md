# Examples of Borrow and Lend Orders

The following subpages will cover over an example of each type of borrow and lend order, and the effect it has upon the application.



{% content-ref url="how-to-offer-a-loan.md" %}
[how-to-offer-a-loan.md](how-to-offer-a-loan.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="how-to-lend-now.md" %}
[how-to-lend-now.md](how-to-lend-now.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="how-to-request-a-borrow.md" %}
[how-to-request-a-borrow.md](how-to-request-a-borrow.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="how-to-borrow-now.md" %}
[how-to-borrow-now.md](how-to-borrow-now.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



Note that the state of the orderbook may not be the same when you use the application. You are encouraged to interact with your orders from multiple margin accounts while testing; get creative, try different combinations of actions, amounts, and rates, and push the boundaries of the application.
