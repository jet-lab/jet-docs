# Bet on BTC going down

* Amelia is bearish on BTC in the short term.
* She deposits USDC into the Jet V2 application, which immediately begins earning interest.
* Using her USDC as collateral, she sets up a leverage swap from BTC to USDC, which will borrow BTC and swap it for USDC in the same transaction. She is now short BTC/USDC.
* She clicks the “max leverage” button and executes the swap.
* Amelia was correct! The price of BTC drops from where Amelia sold it.
* This is a short term trade for Amelia, so she wants to take profit.
* She goes back to the swap screen and reverses the order of the swap so that it will swap USDC to BTC.
* She clicks the “account balance” button in order to trade all of the USDC in her account for BTC.
* She also clicks the toggle button labeled “repay BTC loan” on the order panel so that her BTC debt will be repaid in the same transaction as the swap.
* She will be left with only USDC in her account, the original amount + profits.
* Amelia successfully borrowed BTC at a higher price than she repaid it at, earning a profit!
