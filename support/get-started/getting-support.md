# Getting Support

The best place to ask for support from the community will be within the [Jet Protocol Discord](https://discord.gg/RW2hsqwfej) server's \#Support channel. As always, it's critical you stay super vigilant to avoid any phishing or scamming attempts. Jet Protocol's team and community should never ask you for private information like your mnemonic seed phrase, private keys or for you to send funds at any point. 

If answers to your questions are not found in the \#Support channel you can email support@jetprotocol.io and someone will get back to you.
