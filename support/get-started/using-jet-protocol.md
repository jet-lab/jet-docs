# How to Create a Margin Account



1.  **Create Solana wallet**

    \
    To use Jet Protocol, you need a Solana wallet, you can find a list of compatible wallets [here](wallets.md). Jet Protocol is non-custodial and permissionless borrowing and lending protocol on Solana blockchain. You will interact directly with your wallet. You may create as many Margin Accounts associated with your wallet for your needs.\

2.  **Get some SOL and move SOL to your wallet**

    \
    Jet Protocol is built on Solana blockchain, there is a small transaction fee and Account rent fee, you can find more details [here](https://docs.solana.com/transaction\_fees) on transaction fees, and [here](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#rent) on rent fee. Solana transaction fees are only a fraction of a cent per transaction, but a minimum balance of 0.1 SOL is recommended.\
    \
    Your options for obtaining some SOL are:

    1. Purchase SOL on a centralized exchange of your choice.&#x20;
    2. Purchase SOL through a fiat on-ramp service, which are integrated into some wallets.

    \
