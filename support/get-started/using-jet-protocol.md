# How to Create a Margin Account



1.  **Create Solana wallet**

    \
    To use Jet Protocol, you need a Solana wallet, you can find a list of compatible wallets [here](wallets.md). Jet Protocol is non-custodial and permissionless borrowing and lending protocol on Solana blockchain. You will interact directly with your wallet. You may create as many Margin Accounts associated with your wallet for your needs.\

2.  **Get some SOL and move SOL to your wallet**

    \
    Jet Protocol is built on Solana blockchain, there is a small transaction fee and Account rent fee, you can find more details [here](https://docs.solana.com/transaction\_fees) on transaction fees, and [here](https://docs.solana.com/terminology#rent) on rent fee. Solana transaction fees are only a fraction of a cent per transaction, but a minimum balance of 0.1 SOL is recommended.\
    \
    Your options for obtaining some SOL are:

    1. Purchase SOL on a centralized exchange of your choice.&#x20;
    2. Purchase SOL through a fiat on-ramp service, which are integrated into some wallets.

    \
    Fund wallet by moving SOL to wallet through depositing or sending SOL to your wallet address.\

3.  **Connect your wallet**\
    \
    To begin using Jet Protocol please visit [app.jetprotocol.io](https://app.jetprotocol.io).\

**Optional: Create more margin accounts**\
\
If you find a need to keep track of different portfolio, do create a different Margin Account. Each Margin Account keeps its Risk Level. [Read more information about the Risk Level of a margin account](https://docs.jetprotocol.io/jet-protocol/protocol/risk-indicator).

To continue, you must upgrade the state of your margin account. You will be prompted to confirm the transaction in your wallet. Please note that if you are using a hardware wallet, it may require you to sign multiple times.



Now that you have a margin account created, you can deposit some collateral and use the Jet products with that collateral! [Check out the products page](../../protocol/jet-products/) to learn more about Jet Fixed Rate application, variable pooled lending, and leverage swaps.
