**Setting Up Your Wallet**

Before you are able to begin using Jet Protocol, be sure to setup and fund your wallet of choice from above. We strongly recommend using the securest method possible to store and access your private keys, mnemonic seed phrase and credentials. 

Aside from the assets you use to borrow and lend on Jet Protocol, your wallet should have a small amount of SOL deposited to it to pay for transaction fees.
