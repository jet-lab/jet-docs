# âœˆ Protocol

Jet Protocol is best conceived as a constellation of products centered around the margin program.

Jet Protocol core infrastructure includes:

* **Margin Accounts:** The Margin Account is similar to wallet, it allows user to margin their positions across all assets, products from the protocol.
* **Margin Pools:** The Margin Pools are traditional DeFi lending pools, engineered to lean on the Margin Accounts for collateral management.
* **Fixed-Term Markets:** The Fixed-Term Markets provide users fixed-term and fixed-rate lending and borrowing on-chain.

Other products are supported by connecting external protocols to the margin program:

* **Leverage Swaps:** Jet Swap program routes order to trading venue with most advantageous execution for the user.
  * Note that Orca, Saber, and Openbook are **external** protocols that Jet does not have any control over. Jet Margin program allows user's Margin Account to interface with these protocols for the purpose of swapping tokens.
